## 🛠️ Configuration

### Choose Your Model

Edit the agent initialization:
```python
# Fast and efficient (recommended for most tasks)
agent = OllamaDataAgent(model_name="llama3.2")

# Better for complex code generation
agent = OllamaDataAgent(model_name="codellama")

# Most powerful (requires 16GB+ RAM)
agent = OllamaDataAgent(model_name="llama3.1")
```

### Custom Ollama Server
```python
agent = OllamaDataAgent(
    model_name="llama3.2",
    base_url="http://your-server:11434"
)
```
